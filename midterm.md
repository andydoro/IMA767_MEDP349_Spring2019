## Lighting Technologies (Maker-Friendly)

### LEDs

* The latest in lighting technology. Come in different colors, even invisible (infrared, ultraviolet).
* Come in RGB packages which can be used for color mixing.
* Come in strip / panel forms. Bendy imitation neon.
* "Smart" RGB LEDs such as the [Neopixel](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide) or [Dotstar](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds) which require a microcontroller but allow for individual pixel control.

### EL Wire / Tape / Panel

* Requires an AC inverter which can create an annoying high pitched noise.
* Flexible, so often used in wearables.

### Incandescent Bulbs

* Requires large power source, usually AC. Not energy efficient.

### Flourescent Bulbs
