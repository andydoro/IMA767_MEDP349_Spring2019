# Midterm

Design a lamp, night-light, or light sculpture of some kind. This can be interpreted in the most expansive way possible. Make it interesting. You don't need to see by it. 

You don't need to use an Arduino- that's optional. 

Think about what lighting technology (or technologies) you'd like to use, what material, and diffusion of the light (such as with a lamp shade). One interesting technology for diffusion is the [light valve](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3330), which changes opacity depending on the voltage applied to it.

You can also consider other interesting optical properties such as total internal reflection, used to great effect in this [rainbow light sculpture](https://learn.adafruit.com/glue-stick-archway). [Edge lighting acrylic](https://learn.adafruit.com/led-acrylic-sign/) is another related idea.

## Lighting Technologies (Maker-Friendly)

### [LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/category/37)

* The latest in lighting technology. Come in different colors, even invisible (infrared, ultraviolet).
* Can appear in RGB packages which can be used for color mixing.
* Can come in [strip](https://www.adafruit.com/category/86) or panel forms. [Bendy imitation neon](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3861).
* "Smart" RGB LEDs such as the [Neopixel](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide) or [Dotstar](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds) which require a microcontroller allow for individual pixel control.
* LEDs are replacing classic incandescent bulb and even ["Edison bulbs"](https://www.amazon.com/LED-Bulbs-Antique-Replica-Style-Light/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A2314207011%2Cp_n_feature_three_browse-bin%3A4906234011). 

### [EL Wire / Tape / Panel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/50)

* Requires an AC inverter which can create an annoying high pitched noise.
* Flexible, so often used in wearables.
* EL panels can be cut into shapes.
